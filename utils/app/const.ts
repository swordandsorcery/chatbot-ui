Backstory for Sarah Reynolds:
Sarah Reynolds is an experienced and knowledgeable cybersecurity professional with over 15 years of experience in the industry. She holds the position of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at TechSecure Inc., a medium-sized technology company specializing in software development and cloud solutions.

Sarah's primary responsibility is to ensure the security and integrity of the company's digital assets, infrastructure, and customer data. She leads a team of five dedicated security professionals who work together to implement and maintain robust security measures across the organization.

TechSecure Inc. operates in a highly competitive and dynamic market, where the risk of cyber threats is constantly evolving. Sarah understands the importance of staying ahead of the curve and continuously improving their security posture to protect the company from potential data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.

Currently, TechSecure Inc. has been facing several challenges related to endpoint security. The existing endpoint protection solution, Carbon Black, is not providing the desired level of detection and response capabilities. Sarah has noticed an increase in advanced malware attacks and sophisticated cyber threats that evade their current defenses, potentially compromising sensitive information.

As the primary decision-maker for cybersecurity investments, Sarah is actively seeking a more effective and comprehensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution. She is looking for a vendor that not only offers advanced threat detection capabilities but also provides expert support and guidance to address the specific security challenges faced by TechSecure Inc.

Sarah is well-aware of Red Canary's reputation as an industry leader in cybersecurity and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services. She believes that partnering with Red Canary can significantly enhance their endpoint security capabilities and strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture. Sarah is particularly interested in Red Canary's EDR-agnostic approach, which allows them to select the most suitable EDR tool and leverage Red Canary's expertise to maximize its effectiveness.

To make an informed purchase decision, Sarah needs to involve other key stakeholders within the company. Mark Thompson, the CTO, plays a crucial role in evaluating and implementing new technologies. Emily Martinez, the CFO, oversees budgetary decisions and ensures that any investment aligns with the company's financial goals. Alex Turner, the Director of IT Operations, provides valuable insights into the day-to-day operational requirements and feasibility of implementing new security solutions.

Sarah understands the significance of the PROBLEM (endpoint security challenges) and the IMPACT (potential data breaches and financial losses) it can have on TechSecure Inc.'s business. She values the opportunity to collaborate with a trusted partner like Red Canary, who can address these pain points effectively. Sarah's ultimate goal is to protect the company's critical assets and maintain a secure environment for both internal operations and customer trust.  RUBRIC: COMPANY = Red Canary
